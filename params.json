{"body":"TConsole is a testing console for Rails. It allows you to issue commands\r\nconcerning what tests to run, and see their test output. It's also got a\r\nhelpful reload command for when your Rails environment needs to be\r\nrestarted.\r\n\r\nTConsole should work in pretty much any Unix environment and will work with apps running Ruby 1.9. It can be run on pretty much any test suite that uses MiniTest, including Rails test suites.\r\n\r\nSee it in Action\r\n------\r\nThere's a quick screencast on Vimeo about TConsole's basic features: [Meet TConsole!](https://vimeo.com/37641415)\r\n\r\nWhy use TConsole?\r\n------\r\n\r\n* A large amount of time is wasted loading the Rails environment each time you run the Rails testing rake tasks. TConsole loads the environment when you start the console and whenever you reload the environment, but doesn't have to reload the environment for each test execution.\r\n* The Rails rake task syntax `bundle exec rake test:units TEST=test/unit/user_test.rb` can be pretty verbose when you're running specific tests. Yeah, there are tricks you can use to shorten things up, but still, that's crazy long. tconsole lets you just type `test/unit/user_test.rb` to get that specific test file to run. With TConsole  you can just type `UserTest` and the test runs!\r\n* TConsole makes it dead simple to review how long your tests are taking to run and pinpoint your slowest running tests.\r\n* Re-running failed tests is as easy as typing `!failed` with TConsole.\r\n\r\nWhat about Spork?\r\n------\r\n[Spork](https://github.com/sporkrb/spork)'s really cool, and it was my primary motivation behind writing tconsole, but I've always felt like having an extra console open for my spork server and another to run my commands is a bit heavy for what I want to do. Beyond that, I couldn't ever figure out how to get Spork to work with test/unit, and since me and DHH are the only two people who still use test/unit I figured it was up to me to come up with something that worked great. If Spork's your cup of tea, though, stop reading this and use what you like.\r\n\r\nWhat about rspec?\r\n------\r\nWe've decided to focus on integrating with MiniTest as tightly as possible, rather than worrying about rspec support.\r\n\r\nInstalling TConsole\r\n------\r\n    gem install tconsole\r\n\r\nPrereleases of TConsole come out pretty frequently. You can install the latest prerelease version with:\r\n\r\n    gem install tconsole --pre\r\n    \r\nIf you're using bundler, you probably want to simply add TConsole to your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem \"tconsole\"\r\n\r\nHow to use TConsole\r\n------\r\nIn your shell of choice, cd into your Rails project's directory and then run `bundle exec tconsole` to fire up the console. You should see something like this:\r\n\r\n\tbundle exec tconsole\r\n\r\n\tLoading your Rails environment...\r\n\tEnvironment loaded in 7.160264s.\r\n\r\n\t>\r\n\r\nNow that you're in the console, let's test out the `all` command! Running `all` from the console runs all of your unit, functional, and integration tests:\r\n\r\n\t> all\r\n\tRunning tests...\r\n\r\n\tRun options:\r\n\r\n\t# Running tests:\r\n\r\n\t....................................................................................\r\n\r\n\tFinished tests in 6.054574s, 6.4999 tests/s, 10.5822 assertions/s.\r\n\r\n\t39 tests, 45 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\r\n\r\n\tTest time (including load): 82.806741s\r\n\r\n\t>\r\n\r\nIf you want to focus in on a particular subset of your tests, like units, functionals, or integration, just enter that keyword:\r\n\r\n    > units\r\n\r\n    > functionals\r\n\r\n    > integration\r\n\r\nYou can also specify to run all tests in a specific class:\r\n\r\n    > UserTest\r\n\r\nYou can dig a bit deeper and just run a particular test in that file as\r\nwell:\r\n\r\n    > UserTest#test_that_user_is_healthy\r\n\r\nYou can list more than just one class or class and method to run, and\r\nTConsole will run them all.\r\n\r\n    > UserTest InvoiceTest SubscriptionTest#test_that_renew_renews_the_subscription\r\n\r\nThere are a few special ! commands that use data from past test runs. The `!failed` command will rerun the set of tests that failed during the last run:\r\n\r\n\t> !failed\r\n\r\nThere's also a `!timings` command that will show you a listing of your last test run's test times, sorted to help you\r\nimprove slow tests:\r\n\r\n\t> !timings\r\n\r\n\tTimings from last run:\r\n\r\n\t0.042632s PostTest#test_new_post_should_not_be_published\r\n\t0.033892s PostTest#test_post_should_have_a_title\r\n\t0.033134s PostsControllerTest#test_can_reach_all_posts\r\n\t0.007098s PostsControllerTest#test_grabs_posts\r\n\t0.006212s PostsControllerTest#test_displays_published_posts_by_default\r\n\t0.006107s PostTest#test_post_cannot_have_an_empty_body\r\n\t0.002197s PostTest#test_post_should_have_a_publish_date_set_when_published\r\n\t0.001937s PostTest#test_post_cannot_have_an_empty_title\r\n\t0.001232s PostTest#test_post_should_have_an_initial_state\r\n\t0.001128s PostTest#test_post's_state_should_change_when_published\r\n\t0.001056s PostTest#test_returning_only_published_posts\r\n\t0.000923s PostTest#test_post_should_have_respond_to_published_appropriately\r\n\t0.000770s PostTest#test_post_should_have_a_body\r\n\r\nYou can turn on the Fail Fast feature to cause TConsole to stop running\r\ntests as soon as the first test fails. To enable fail fast simply enter:\r\n\r\n  > set fast on\r\n\r\nIn the console. You can disable Fail Fast again with:\r\n\r\n  > set fast off\r\n\r\nIf you update your environment, maybe by editing your Gemfile or changing one of your application's configuration files, you can use the `reload` command to reload the entire environment:\r\n\r\n\t> reload\r\n\r\nAnd then finally, you can run the `exit` command to quit:\r\n\r\n\t> exit\r\n\r\nCommand Line Options\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSince TConsole is primarily meant to be run as an interactive console, it\r\ndoesn't have many command line arguments, but there are a few.\r\nTConsole also passes any parameters that it doesn't know through to be\r\nrun as its initial command. So, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> tconsole all\r\n```\r\n\r\npasses `all` through as the first command to be run, so that command\r\nwould start TConsole and immediately run all tests. There's a `--once`\r\noption that can be used if you'd simply like to run a single command by\r\npassing it to the TConsole command in then exit.\r\n\r\nThe only other TConsole command line option is `--trace`. `--trace` is\r\nprimarily useful for diagnosing problems with TConsole.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration Files\r\n------\r\n\r\nTConsole attempts to load a .tconsole file in your home directory\r\nand in your project directory, in that order, to configure your preferred defaults for TConsole. In many situations you won't need to edit your TConsole configuration files to run TConsole, because it includes a sane set of defaults and attempts to auto-detect Rails applications. \r\n\r\nHere's a commented example configuration file:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nTConsole::Config.run do |config|\r\n  # Configures the directory where your tests are located\r\n  config.test_dir = \"./test\"\r\n\r\n  # Include paths that should be added to Ruby's load path\r\n  config.include_paths = [\"./test\", \"./lib\"]\r\n\r\n  # Paths that should be preloaded. You'll have to run the reload\r\n  # command to reload these paths in TConsole\r\n  config.preload_paths = [\"./config/application\"]\r\n\r\n  # File sets are the named sets of files that can be executed. A file\r\n  # set named \"all\" must be included.\r\n  config.file_sets = {\r\n    \"all\" => [\"test/**/*_test.rb\"],\r\n    \"units\" => [\"test/units/**/*_test.rb\"]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  # Fail fast specifies whether or not tests should stop executing once\r\n  # the first failure occurs.\r\n  config.fail_fast = true\r\n\r\n  # Specifies code to be run before loading the environment\r\n  config.before_load do\r\n    ENV[\"RAILS_ENV\"] ||= \"test\"\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  # Specifies code to be run after loading the environment\r\n  config.after_load do\r\n    ::Rails.application\r\n    ::Rails::Engine.class_eval do\r\n      def eager_load!\r\n        # turn off eager_loading\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  # Specifies code to be run before each test execution\r\n  config.before_test_run do\r\n    puts \"I'm about to run!!!\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nReporting Issues and Contributing\r\n------\r\n\r\nFeel free to report issues in the issue tracker at https://github.com/commondream/tconsole/issues.

For bonus points, fork the project and send me a pull request with the fix for the issue you're seeing.\r\n\r\n*How embarrassing?!?! A testing tool with no tests?* At first TConsole was just a bit of experimental code, so test coverage is light. I am working on improving that, though.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-----\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Alan Johnson\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
